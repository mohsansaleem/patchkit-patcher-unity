In this repository you can find PatchKit Patcher Unity project.

## Getting the stable version

It's pretty important to use a stable and tester patcher version. You will find stable releases in [here](https://github.com/patchkit-net/patchkit-patcher-unity/releases). Be careful, **pre-releases** are not suitable for production usage. **Master** branch is also not suitable for production usage. Always look for tags if you want to do an upgrade.
