Don't stress out if you see the following error:

Unhandled Exception: System.TypeLoadException: Could not load type 'Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JContainer' from assembly 'Newtonsoft.Json, Version=8.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=30ad4fe6b2a6aeed'.

1. Go to Edit / Project Settings / Player
2. Locate Api Compatibility Level option (it's under Optimization category)
3. Switch it to ".NET 2.0"
4. After a few seconds the error should be gone and everything should be working fine.
